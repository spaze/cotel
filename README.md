Cotel: companies intel
======================
A ***prototype*** for a library of links to articles describing how companies do their things. *For source code archeologists only.*

The code is of prototype and proof-of-concept quality, it's messy and I don't like it either. I wanted to nuke it from orbit but the data might be of some use to somebody so here it is, with source code and fries. You've been warned.
